# The Reserve

A collaboration between [nftchance](https://twitter.com/nftchance) and [charliemarketplace](https://twitter.com/charliemktplace) to create a new type of financial guardrail.

## What is The Reserve?

The Reserve is a new way to interaction with decentralized financial mechanisms on EVM chains. At the core, it is a smart contract that allows you to join existing financial management strategies.

Digital currencies are rarely a good store of value. They are volatile and can be subject to manipulation. The Reserve is a way to protect your assets from the volatility of the market with the introduction and newly acquired trust.

With The Reserve, an individual can join a strategy without having to trust the strategy creator; every strategy and the actions it can perform are verified and enforced on-chain. Historically, this has been a problem for DeFi, where users have had to trust the creator of a strategy to not steal their funds or perform malicious actions. Additionally, without the ability to trust a strategy manager, capital could not be pooled together to create a larger strategy with increased returns.

> This contract is a work in progress. It is highly experimental. Things will change. Things will break. Use at your own risk. We are not responsible for any losses you may incur nor do we guarantee any returns nor do we guarantee that this contract will work as intended. This is a piece of research that explores the possibilities of what can be done with smart contracts to provide better security and usher in the day of institutional money in DeFi.
